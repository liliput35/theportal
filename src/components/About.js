                <small>by Lorenz Ciocon</small>

                <p>The Marvel Movie Portal is a platform that I coded for you to enjoy. It is a site that is made to connect you to your favorite marvel films. 
                    It generates links where you will go to enjoy your favorite movies. Some movies have different links due to technical issues. The google drive links are uploaded by me for a more secure experience. 
                    Use non drive links at your own risk. Welcome to The Portal
